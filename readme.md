# World Of Warcraft model 3d 

this project is simply because I have just a model 3d modified (in post-processing) and try to integrate a design such [worldofwarcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/fr-fr/ "worldofwarcraft") website.

`use npm install and npm start`

Just **THREE.js**, **GSAP** and **vanilla javascript**
